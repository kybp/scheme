# scheme

Simple C++11 Scheme interpreter based off Peter Norvig's
[lis.py](http://norvig.com/lispy.html). For datatypes, only fixnums,
symbols, functions, bools, and proper lists have been implemented. For
special forms, there is define, lambda, if, and, or, and quote. For
primitive functions, there is +, -, *, abs, not, <, >, and =.
